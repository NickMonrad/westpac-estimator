# Monrad Estimator

A full-stack project estimation tool that replaces a manual spreadsheet process. It produces scoped backlogs, effort summaries, resource profiles, timelines, and eventually SOW documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (recommended — easiest way to run PostgreSQL locally)

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

**With Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name monrad-pg \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=monrad_estimator \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15
```

**Without Docker (existing PostgreSQL install):** ensure a database named `monrad_estimator` exists and update `DATABASE_URL` in step 2 with your credentials.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install          # installs root + all workspaces
```

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

`server/.env.example` contains sensible defaults for local development. Edit it if your PostgreSQL credentials differ from the Docker command above.

#### Email / SMTP (optional)

Email is used for password reset links and org invite emails. Without SMTP configured, both flows still work — the email content and link are printed to the server console instead.

To enable real email delivery, add the following to `server/.env`:

```env
SMTP_HOST="smtp-relay.brevo.com"   # or your provider's SMTP host
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-smtp-login"
SMTP_PASS="your-smtp-key-or-password"
SMTP_FROM="Monrad Estimator <you@yourdomain.com>"
CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"  # base URL used in email links
```

**Recommended free providers:**

| Provider | Free tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Brevo](https://brevo.com) | 300 emails/day | SMTP login = account email, password = generated SMTP key |
| [Resend](https://resend.com) | 3,000 emails/month | Requires a verified domain |
| [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) | 100 emails/day | Industry standard |

For **Brevo**: generate an SMTP key at *Settings → SMTP & API → SMTP*, then verify a sender address at *Senders & IPs → Add a sender*.

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Start development servers

```bash
npm run dev          # API on :3001 + Vite on :5173 (concurrently)
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Server unit/integration tests
cd server && npm test

# TypeScript check
cd server && npx tsc --noEmit
cd client && npx tsc --noEmit

# E2E (requires both dev servers running)
cd e2e && ./node_modules/.bin/playwright test --workers=1
```

## Phases & Progress

### ✅ Phase 1 — Foundation
Repo setup, Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind, Express + Prisma, DB schema, JWT auth, project CRUD.

### ✅ Phase 2 — Backlog Builder
Backlog hierarchy (Epic → Feature → Story → Task), tree view UI, manual entry, resource type management, bidirectional hours/days input. CSV export/import with 3-step staging workflow, upsert-by-hierarchy re-import, status columns (EpicStatus/FeatureStatus/StoryStatus), and Template link on stories.

### ✅ Phase 3 — Template Library
Feature Template data model + API, Template Library UI, template-based backlog generation (select template + complexity → creates tasks). Globally unique template names enforced. Templates linkable to stories via CSV import/export.

### ✅ Phase 4 — Effort Review
Effort summary API grouped by resource type and epic. Summary view with expandable epic sub-rows, cost columns (day rate + estimated cost, conditional on rate data), and category subtotals. Detail view with Excel-like column filters (Epic, Feature, Story, Resource Type dropdowns + task name text search), cascading filter dropdowns, cost per task, and totals rows. Active-scope toggle to focus on in-scope items only.

### ✅ Phase 5 — Timeline Planner
Timeline data model + API with dependency-aware auto-scheduler, proportional pool resource levelling, and fractional-week durations. SVG Gantt chart with feature and story bars, drag-and-drop manual scheduling with override indicators, inter-feature dependency arrows, sequential/parallel epic mode toggle, resource demand histogram, custom feature colours (colour picker saved to `Feature.timelineColour`), over-allocation indicators (red dot on Gantt bars in over-allocated weeks), and onboarding/buffer zone visualisation (amber onboarding zone at chart start, indigo buffer zone at chart end). Inline edit panel for start week, duration, and feature dependencies. CSV export (Gantt + resource demand + named resources) and full-width PNG export (dark-mode aware).

### ✅ Phase 6 — Resource Profile
Per-resource hours/days/cost aggregation with epic → feature → story drill-down, configurable overhead items (% of task days, fixed total days, days per week × project duration), stacked bar chart, FTE calculation, dual CSV exports (resource profile + full project zip). Per-resource `hoursPerDay` and `dayRate` overrides support multi-locale teams (e.g. AU 7.6h vs NZ 8h). Onboarding/buffer weeks panel: onboarding weeks allocated to Full Project and Overhead resources before delivery begins; buffer weeks appended at project end. Allocation mode-aware named resource bars on Timeline (FULL_PROJECT spans full project; TIMELINE uses derived or manual range; T&M shows demand bars). Cost Summary Period column shows mode-correct date ranges. See [#6](https://github.com/NickMonrad/monrad-estimator/issues/6).

### 🚧 Phase 7 — Document Generation *(in progress)*
Scope document and Statement of Work as PDF + Word (.docx), configurable branding and section toggles. Phase 7a (programmatic PDF scope document) shipped in [#129](https://github.com/NickMonrad/monrad-estimator/pull/129). See [#7](https://github.com/NickMonrad/monrad-estimator/issues/7).

### 🚧 Phase 8 — Cost Basis & Rate Cards *(partially started)*
Day rates per resource type (global defaults + project overrides) and cost columns in Effort Review are shipped. Remaining: per-resource-type discounts, project-level discounts (value/duration/manual), cost summary UI, cost section in SOW. See [#8](https://github.com/NickMonrad/monrad-estimator/issues/8).

### 🚧 Phase 9 — AI Backlog Generator *(not started)*
"Generate from brief" using OpenAI or Claude, AI-suggested templates at appropriate complexity. See [#9](https://github.com/NickMonrad/monrad-estimator/issues/9).
